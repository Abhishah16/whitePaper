## scRNA-seq + FISH as a case study for spatial transcriptomics

### Overview and biological question

### Computational challenges

#### Challenge 1: overlay of scRNA-seq onto seqFISH for resolution enhancement 

#### Challenge 2: determine signatures of cellular co-localization or spatial coordinates in non-spatial scRNA-seq
