## Challenges for interpretation


### Interpretation for quantitative team: requires a good understanding of the methods (no black boxes, a common language)

Communicating within the field: what approaches are we talking about, this requires agreement on a glossary (ref: Table1). 
Supervised versus unsupervised methods.
Visualization figures are useful for the mathematical and data science team in the Explorator phase. 

### Interpretation for biologists:
Understanding the output from the analyses of the data is facilitated by the incorporation of contiguous information.
Redundant biological knowledge and incorporation of information from databases are important in the workflow.
Biological interpretations are facilitated by bridges to databases such as KEGG, Gene Ontology, Human Cell Atlas, Biomart and many other databases.
Validation  through complementary data and sequential experimental design.

### Visualization tools for interpretation and communication to biologists
There are pitfalls in using sophisticated graphics which lead to over-interpretation or misinterpretation
(size of clusters in tSNE related to sampling baselines rather than density, ...)
Example of effective visual interpretation tools : brushing UMAP (Kris Sankaran).

### Explaining results to biologists through generative models and simulations (ex: Factor Analysis).
Several difficulties arise when explaining summaries and conclusions, problems encountered include non-identifiability of models
or non-sufficiency of summaries, simulations can often provide effective communication tools.


### Issues of over-discretization, over-simplification
Example 1: The notion of cell-type is insufficient (Communication challenge with biologists about tradeoffs between focusing on rare cell types vs. more “continuous” view on cell types).

Problem with loss of information in the desire to simplify.
