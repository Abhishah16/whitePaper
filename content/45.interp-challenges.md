## Challenges for interpretation


### Interpretation requires a good understanding of the methods (no black boxes, a common language)

Communicating within the field: what approaches are we talking about?

Ref to Glossary of terms


### Interpretation of the output from the analyses of the data is facilitated by the incorporation of contiguous information.

Redundant biological knowledge and incorporation of information from databases are important in the process.
Biological Interpretations: bridges to data bases such as KEGG, Gene Ontology, HCA.
Validation  through complementary data.

### Visualization tools for interpretation and communication

Examples: Brushing UMAP.

### Explaining results to biologists through generative models and simulations (ex: Factor Analysis).

### Issues of over-discretization, over-simplification

Example 1: The notion of cell-type is insufficient (Communication challenge with biologists about tradeoffs between focusing on rare cell types vs. more “continuous” view on cell types).

Problem with loss of information in the desire to simplify.

Over interpretation of graphical outputs
