## Software strategies to enable analyses of multimodal single cell experiments

### Key questions 

* How should multimodal single cell data be managed for interactive and batch analyses?
* What methods will help software developers create scalable solutions for multimodal single cell analysis?
* How can we ensure that visualization methods that are central to multimodal single cell analysis
are usable by researchers with visual impairments?

### Data management strategies

* Abstract data type: "multiassay experiment".  This reflects the idea that each mode will
be characterized by a different collection of features on possibly non-overlapping collections
of samples.  The metadata on features should be clearly and conventionally defined.  For example,
genes and transcripts are enumerated using Ensembl catalog identifiers; regions of accessibility
are defined using genomic coordinates in a clearly specified reference build.  Metadata on
samples must include all relevant information on experimental conditions such as treatment,
protocol, and date of technical processing.

**Key points:**
1) What do we want to store and share? Data object vs analysis object. How would the design change based on what is stored?
2) Do we need a flexible, universal framework (e.g. MAE) or an experiment class for every possible combination of modalities or technologies?
3) Do we have adequate data representation for all “assays”?

   - Multi-modal single cell data may consist of multi-assay measurements from the same cell (e.g. citeSeq, sci-CAR) or integration of multi-assay measurements from distinct cells from the same or distinct starting samples. A sample here refers to the biological specimen of origin (tissue A from individual X).
A data container for a multi assay analysis must hold 
   1) Assay slots containing variables or features from multiple modalities (e.g. gene expression units from sc-RNAseq and protein units from sc-proteomics). In some cases, the feature may be multidimensional (e.g. spatial coordinates, locations of eQTLs).
   2) Observations or cell identities
   3) Metadata for sample of origin for the individual cells, e.g. study, center, phenotype, perturbation. 
   4) A map between the different assays to enable analysis

   - The MAE is such a Bioconductor container for overlapping observations, and may serve as a starting point for further expansion. Besides the primary data elements for storing “data objects”, the summarizedExperiment class offers attributes and Methods for storing results of analysis, as an “analysis object”. 
      - While common assays such as RNAseq and ATACseq have well-defined data representations (e.g. transcript names), data representation need to be defined newer assays, which may need multiple dimensions for adequate definition (e.g. x, y, z coordinates for images).
      - The observations of different modalities may not be directly comparable (e.g. RNA may be measured from individual cells but spatial transcriptomics may cover a few cells in the matched area).  
      - In the absence of universal standards, the metadata may vary from analysis to analysis.

(Note, standard BioC container/class terms may not be correctly used. End of fodder - AS)
