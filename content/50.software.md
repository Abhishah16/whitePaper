## Data structures and software packages to enable analyses

Basic objectives: 

* Support development of efficient data containers/data services, balancing abstraction
with concrete responsiveness to new biotechnologies
* Support software developers in achievement of scalability in their tools
* Support end-users in adoption and successful use


### A software ecosystem for multimodal single cell genomics

* Defining the ecosystem; scope and principles of evolution
* Current content targets
    * spatial transcriptomics
    * scNMT-seq ...
* Governance concepts

### Containers for developers and users
