## Introduction 

### Multi-omics and multi-view single cell technologies

- Do multi-omics answer our biological questions?
    Single cell community has naturally adopted a data-driven approach
    Helpful to complement with hypothesis-driven and mechanistic-driven
    approaches
    Technological advances will help refine our hypothesis (e.g. multi-modal
    studies focusing on a set of specific genes)
    Can tell us how different levels of regulation are influencing each other


- State-of-the-art

Brief overview of our three hackathon studies


- What do we hope to learn from multi-omics / multi view single cell studies

What bulk TCGA has taught us:
    Type of omics that can answer a specific biological question
    The value of open resources for methodological developments
    New hypotheses

New single cell multi omics initiatives:
    Human Cell Atlas (HCA): assess variation in normal tissues
    Human Tumor Atlas Network (HTAN):
      Clinical, experimental, computational framework to generate three- dimensional atlases of cancer transitions for diverse tumor types. Single-cell, longitudinal, and clinical outcomes

-  Are our technologies ready? 

  Are technologies capturing the information we want
  Our hackathons featuing cutting edge technologies have showed that:
    Issues with noise and experimental design
    Time lag between regulatory levels not addressed and many open questions
remain (e.g methylation / gene expression)
    Direction of regulation not captured
    
    
- Objectives of this paper
    Provide guidelines on tools / data / technologies / methods and needs to model the multi-scale regulatory processes in biological systems for a computational biologist audience
    
    
- Outline and messages
    Cellular and molecular regulation is fundamentally multi-scale and captured by distinct data modalities
    Traditional hypothesis-driven multi-omics/view studies only consider one facet of these technologies, but more can be learned through a holistic approach extending into atlases
    We present our learnings from some hackathons case studies that helped us obtain a broader picture and language
