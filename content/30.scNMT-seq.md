### scNMT-seq as a case-study for epigenetic regulation

#### Overview and biological question

#### Computational challenges

* Identification of multi-omics signatures that characterize lineage, stage or both.
* Handling missing values
* Do epigenetic changes in some genomic contexts affect cell fate decision more than others? If so, how?

#### Methods for stats/math analyses and results summary
