### scRNA-seq + FISH as a case study for spatial transcriptomics

#### Overview and biological question

#### Computational challenges

* Can scRNA-seq data be overlaid onto seqFISH for resolution enhancement
* What is the minimal number of genes needed for data integration?
* Are there signatures of cellular co-localization or spatial coordinates in the non-spatial scRNA-seq data?

#### Methods for stats/maths analyses and results summary
