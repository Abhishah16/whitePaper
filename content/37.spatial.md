### Spatial proteomics and cross-study analysis

#### Overview and biological question

#### Computational challenges

* Integrating partially-overlapping proteomic data collected on different patients with similar phenotypes
* Integration of spatial x-y coordinate co-location and co-expression
* Integration with other 'omics datasets (e.g., scRNA-seq) to support the results of these proteomic analyses
* Can we predict the spatial expression patterns of proteins measured on mass-tag but not measured in the MIBI-TOF data?
* What additional information can we learn about the different macrophage and immune populations in breast cancer by conducting integrated analyses of these datasets?
