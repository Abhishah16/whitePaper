## Techniques and challenges for benchmarking methods

Outline:

* We must first define what we are benchmarking
    - recovery of cell types / clusters
	- discovery of relationships between data modalities, e.g. gene
      regulatory relationships observed between chromatin
      accessibility and gene expression
	- ...
* Strategies for benchmarking
    - simulation (and we can discuss the difficulties with simulating
      covariance structure across features and data modalities)
	- benchmarking datasets
    - cross-validation within study (and we can discuss issues in
      matching dimensions of latent space across folds). For this Mike
      has a lot of literature in Google Doc to include on papers that
      have performed either permutation or cross-validation to assess
      model performance.
    - cross-study validation (are relationships discovered in one
      dataset present in other datasets, potentially looking across
      single cell and bulk)
