## Techniques and challenges for benchmarking methods

### We must first define what we are benchmarking
 * Often the goal in benchmarking is recovery of known cell types with
   processing of raw data, quantification, and clustering. The
   Adjusted Rand Index (ARI) or other metrics for partitions are
   used. 
 * One may also attempt to benchmark methods for their ability to
   discover known relationships between data modalities, e.g. gene
   regulatory relationships observed between chromatin accessibility
   and gene expression. However, this is made difficult by the fact
   that these relationships are not fully known at the single cell
   level.

### Strategies for benchmarking

* Simulation is useful for having known truth, but it is difficult to
  simulate realistic covariance structure across features and across
  data modalities.
* Benchmarking datasets (add examples from Google Doc)
* Cross-validation within study can be performed. For example the
  following cross-validation analysis of the scNMT-seq dataset was
  performed using MOFA+

  A challenge with within study cross-validation is how to 
  match dimensions of latent space across folds. (add examples from
  Google Doc of papers that have performed either permutation or
  cross-validation to assess model performance)
* Cross-study validation would assess if relationships discovered in
  one dataset present in other datasets, potentially looking across
  single cell and bulk.
